Level 6: Contract to Contract (ABI Compliant)
AppID: 724672235
During the OptIn the application will perform an inner transaction call to an app ID you provide,
passing 2 numbers using the ABI method `sum(uint64,uint64)uint64`.
The response (LastLog) must be the sum. The apps creator address must also be the same as the sender.

Solution: Create a smart contract that sums two arguments and returns the result.
